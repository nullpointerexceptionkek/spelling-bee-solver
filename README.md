## Note
This script fetches the dictionary from a popular repo: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/words/an-array-of-english-words/refs/heads/master/index.json`

I have no control over this repo, and you should always check if it contains the actual word list file as it might get replaced by malicious code.
